# Neopets-QOL

## [Half Price Day Tracker](https://github.com/BanksiaFox/Neopets-QOL/blob/main/HPD-tracker.js)
Displays a message at the top of Neopian shops when it is currently half price day, for anyone who repeatedly forgets to take advantage of it. 
When it's **not** half price day, it will display a reminder for how many days until the next. 
When it **is** half price day, a random image will display at the top of the page to grab your attention.
